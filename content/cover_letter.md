Dear Dr. Markel,

We are writing to submit our manuscript entitled “Ten Quick Tip for Deep Learning in Biology” for consideration in _PLOS Computational Biology_'s education section.

Ultimately, we have decided on the following ten tips as being critical for engaging in principled and effective DL-based research:

1. Concepts that apply to machine learning also apply to deep learning
2. Use traditional methods to establish performance baselines
3. Understand the complexities of training deep neural networks
4. Know your data and your question
5. Choose an appropriate data representation and neural network architectures
6. Tune your hyperparameters extensively and systematically
7. Address deep neural networks' increased tendency to overfit the dataset
8. Your DL models can be more transparent
9. Don't over-interpret predictions
10. Don't share models trained on sensitive data

Sincerely,  
Benjamin Lee, on behalf of all authors
