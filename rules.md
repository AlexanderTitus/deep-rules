# Proposed Rules

1. Rules for ML apply to DL (#37 )
  - Garbage In/Garbage Out (#26 )
  - Normalize your data (#7 )
  - Make sure data is not biased/skewed (#43 )
  - Make it reproducible (#21 )
  - Validate it (#27 )
  - Test/train/validate splitting (#20 , #19 )

2. Know your data and your question
  - (#31 , #12 , #13,  #18 )

3. Choose a model appropriate to the data (#29 )
  - A bit of discussion on DL architectures and how they apply to different problems here would be helpful

4. Tune your hyperparameters (#42 , #11 )
  - Again, discussion on DL specific tuning would be helpful. i.e. layers, dropout, activation functions etc.

5. Limit overfitting (#28 )
  - Some discussion on how not to overfit particularly in the context of DL methods.

6. Compare to non-DL methods as baselines (#41 , #11 , #10 )

7. A DL model can be, but doesn't need to be a black box
  - How to interpret DL models (#36 )
  - Similar to #6. Check if DL is actually a significant improvement in performance over a more 'interpretable' model (#25 )

8. Interpret predictions in the correct manner
  - How to apply a model (#30 )
  - Correlation != Causation (#9 )
  - Don't overinterpret (#33 )
