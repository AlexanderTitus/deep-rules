## Ethics {#ethics}

While deep learning is a very powerful tool, it is important that we consider the ethical risks if used inappropriately. 
For example, despite DL methods helping to increase medical efficiency through improved diagnostics and risk assessment, there can be patient biases due to differences in age, race, gender [@doi.org/10.1002/hast.977]; unequal representation of different populations [@doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0048].
Beyond, healthcare, deep learning can reinforce societal prejudices of race [@https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/discrimination-algorithms-disparate-impact/403969/; @https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html ].

It is important to think about how these methods and their potential impact.

Ensure that where necessary your proposed project is compliant with the research ethics approval policies of your institution (e.g., institutional review boards).


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Deep learning techniques have the potential for wide use in biology and the capacity to meet or exceed the performance of both humans and the current state-of-the-art algorithms across a wide range of biological sub-disciplines and tasks.
Beyond simply achieving good predictive performance, deep learning has the potential to inform novel biological insights to fundamentally drive high-impact research.
To realize this potential, the use of deep learning as a research tool must be approached as any other tool would be: scientifically and thoughtfully.
We hope that our tips for applying deep learning to the biological sciences will serve as a starting point for discussion and considering deep learning for biological research sensibly and responsibly.
