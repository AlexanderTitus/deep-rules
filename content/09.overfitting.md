## Tip 7: Address deep neural networks' increased tendency to overfit the dataset {#overfitting}

Overfitting is one of the most significant dangers you'll face in deep learning (and traditional machine learning).
Put simply, overfitting occurs when a model fits patterns in the training data too closely, includes noise or non-scientifically relevant perturbations, or in the most extreme case, simply memorizes patterns in the training set.
This subtle distinction is made clearer by seeing what happens when a model is tested on data to which it was not exposed during training: just as a student who memorizes exam materials struggles to correctly answer questions for which they have not studied, a machine learning model that has overfit to its training data will perform poorly on unseen test data.
Deep learning models are particularly susceptible to overfitting due to their relatively large number of parameters and associated representational capacity.
To continue the student analogy, a smarter student has greater potential for memorization than average one and thus may be more inclined to memorize.

In contrast, a simple linear regression works well on both datasets. The greater representational capacity of the polynomial is analogous to using a larger or deeper neural network.](images/overfitting.png){#fig:overfitting-fig}

To evaluate deep supervised learning models, they should be trained, tuned, and tested on non-overlapping datasets.
The data used for testing should be locked and only used one-time for evaluating the final model after all tuning steps are completed.
Using a test set more than once will lead to biased estimates of the generalization performance [@arxiv:1811.12808; @doi:10.1162/089976698300017197].
Additionally, many conventional metrics for classification (e.g. area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or AUROC) have limited utility in cases of extreme class imbalance [@pmid:25738806].
Model performance should be evaluated with a carefully picked panel of relevant metrics that make minimal assumptions about the composition of the testing data [@doi:10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00578], with particular consideration given to metrics that are most directly applicable to the task at hand.

The simplest way to combat overfitting is to detect it.
This can be done by splitting the dataset into three parts: a training set, a tuning set (also commonly called a validation set in the machine learning literature), and a test set.
By exposing the model solely to the training data during fitting, a researcher can use the model's performance on the unseen test data to measure the amount of overfitting.
While a slight drop in performance from the training set to the test set is normal, a significant drop is a clear sign of overfitting (see Figure @fig:overfitting-fig for a visual demonstration of an overfit model that performs poorly on test data).
In addition, there are a variety of techniques to reduce overfitting during training including data augmentation and regularization techniques such as dropout [@url:http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html] and weight decay [@tag:krogh-weight-decay].
Another way, as described by Chuang and Keiser, is to identify the baseline level of memorization of the network by training on the data with the labels randomly shuffled and to see if the model performs better on the actual data [@doi:10.1021/acschembio.8b00881].
If the model performs no better on real data than randomly scrambled data, then the performance of the model can be attributed to overfitting.

Additionally, in biology and medicine it is critical to consider independence when defining training and test sets.
For example, a DL model for pneumonia detection in chest X-rays performed well but failed to generalize to outside hospitals because they were able to detect which hospital the image was from and exploited this information when making predictions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002683].
Similarly, when dealing with sequence data, holding out data that are evolutionarily related or share structural homology to the training data can result in overfitting.
In these cases, simply holding out test data selected from a random partition of the training data is insufficient.
The best remedy for confounding variables is to [know your data](#know-your-problem) and to test your model on truly independent data.

In essence, practitioners should split data into training, tuning, and single-use testing sets to assess the performance of the model on data that can provide a reliable estimate of its generalization performance.
Futhermore, be cognizant of the danger of skewed or biased data artificially inflating accuracy.
