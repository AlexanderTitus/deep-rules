Dear Dr. Markel:

I am writing to submit a Ten Simple Rules article entitled “Ten Simple Rules for
Deep Learning in Biology.” Deep learning (DL) is exploding in popularity and is
increasingly finding its way into biological data analysis. However, since most
biologists receive little (or no) formal data science training, using deep learning
properly remains a daunting task.

Alone, deep learning is a large and complex field. Additional complexity
is added when applied to biology. Inspired by [*Opportunities and obstacles for
deep learning in biology and medicine*](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387)
and [*Ten Simple Rules for Writing a PLOS Ten Simple Rules
Article*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003858) (Rule 5: Collaborate), I propose
to write the article using
[Manubot](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock), a collaborative
manuscript authoring platform based on GitHub. By writing the manuscript in the
open on GitHub (which is extensively used by those doing deep learning research)
and soliciting input from the community, I hope that the article will be able to
provide actionable, DL-specific guidance for both new and experienced DL
practitioners.


To accomplish this goal, I have created a
[repository](github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules) that will host the discussion
and writing of the manuscript. In preparation for submitting this letter of
inquiry, the following rules have been proposed:

<!-- just using 1. for each entry so that they can be more easily reordered -->

1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum

These rules are chosen so that readers of varying experience levels will be able to gain from the article and range from the high level (Should I use deep learning for this problem?) to implementation best practices.

Upon determination that this manuscript will be suitable for submission to PLOS Computational Biology, I will further engage with the community to solicit feedback and contributions. All authors of the paper will meet the ICMJE authorship standards.

By providing guidance on deep learning, powerful DL methods can be properly utilized by the community towards a deeper understanding of biology. Here, we aim to increase the number of biological researchers that take advanatage of DL methods (by making them more inviting) and improve the overall the quality and reproducibility of the research (by helping them avoid common mistakes).

Sincerely,

Benjamin Lee
