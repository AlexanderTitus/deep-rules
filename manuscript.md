## Abstract {.page_break_before}




## Introduction


## Rule 1: Concepts that apply to machine learning also apply to deep learning



## Rule 2: Understand the complexities of training deep neural networks


## Rule 3: Know your data and your question


## Rule 4: Choose an appropriate neural network architecture and data representation


## Rule 5: Tune your hyperparameters extensively and systematically


## Rule 6: Address deep neural networks' increased tendency to overfit the dataset


## Rule 7: Use traditional methods to establish performance baselines


## Rule 8: Do not necessarily consider a DL model as a black box


## Rule 9: Interpret predictions in the correct manner


## Rule 10: Don't share models trained on sensitive data


## Conclusion
