Dear Dr. Markel,

it is with great enthusiasm that I am writing to submit a presubmission inquiry for a Ten Simple Rules article entitled “Ten Simple Rules for Deep Learning in Biology.” Deep learning (DL) is currenty exploding in popularity and is
increasingly finding its way into biological data analysis given its ability to detect high-dimensional, and for humans invisible, patterns in large-scale biological datasets. However, since most
biologists and also many data scientists have received and still receive little (or no) formal training in DL, correct application of DL to biological data analysis remains a daunting task hindering DL-accelerated scientific progress and enhanced biological insight.


DL is a large and complex field. Additional complexity
is added when applied to biology. Inspired by [*Opportunities and obstacles for
deep learning in biology and medicine*](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387)
and [*Ten Simple Rules for Writing a PLOS Ten Simple Rules
Article*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003858) (Rule 5: Collaborate), I propose
to write the article using
[Manubot](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock), a collaborative
manuscript authoring platform based on GitHub. By writing the manuscript in the
open on GitHub (which is extensively used by those actively performing deep learning research)
and soliciting input from the wider scientific community, I am convinced that this manuscript will
provide actionable, DL-specific guidance for both new and experienced DL
practitioners.


To accomplish this goal, I have created a
[repository](github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules) that will host the discussion
and writing of the manuscript. In preparation for submitting this letter of
inquiry, the following 10 rules have been proposed:

<!-- just using 1. for each entry so that they can be more easily reordered -->

1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum

These rules have been devised to effectively reach audiences of varying DL expertise readers ranging from high level guidance to implementation of best practices.

Upon notification that this manuscript will be suitable for submission to PLOS Computational Biology, I will further engage with the community to solicit feedback and contributions. All authors of the paper will meet the ICMJE authorship standards.

By providing guidance on deep learning, powerful DL methods can be properly utilized by the biological community towards a deeper understanding of biology. Here, we aim to increase the number of biological researchers that take advanatage of DL methods (by making DL more accessible) and improve the overall quality and reproducibility of DL research by helping researchers avoid common pitfalls.

Sincerely,

Benjamin Lee
