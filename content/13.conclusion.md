## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Collectively, our manuscript is focused on the promotion of practical tips distilled from cutting-edge insights and evolving professional standards to advance the efficient and optimal application of deep learning within research.
In addition, a number of our points (see Tips 7, 8, 9, and 10) are intimately linked to safeguarding against key risks.
These include the introduction/perpetuation of bias, the over- and mis-interpretation of models, poor generalizability, and the potential for harm unto others.
If leveraged in ethically and responsibly, deep learning techniques have the potential to add value within a diverse array of research and healthcare contexts, as these techniques have already shown remarkable capacity to meet or exceed the performance of human effort or traditional algorithms across fields and subdisciplines.
Beyond merely achieving good predictive performance in certain tasks, deep learning has the potential to uncover high-impact biological and clinical insights, fundamentally driving research discoveries and delivery of new products to market.		
Yet, to realize its full potential, deep learning must be approached by all with genuine thoughtfulness, caution, and responsibility.		

Through the tips and recommendations provided within this manuscript, we hope to encourage a prudent, vigilant community of computational practitioners, experimental biologists, and clinical scientists: colleagues who, before excitedly stitching together lines of code and datasets, first pause to think critically about their specific research question, create a plan that can maintain rigor, and discern how their work might have far-reaching consequences with ethical dimensions.
This holistic approach will help us to advance accountability, beneficence, and quality in the life sciences.		
Thus, we aim not only to increase the accessibility of deep learning techniques within the life sciences, but also to improve upon the reproducibility and interpretability of high-quality deep learning research in the literature and scientific communityâ€”especially given that published findings, models, and datasets will be leveraged to yield innovative tools, services, and products.		
Indeed, we hope that these tips will serve as a powerful engine for promoting meaningful discussions, reflections, team learnings, and best practices to drive collaboration that fosters cutting-edge deep learning innovation, sensibly and responsibly.
