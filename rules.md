# Proposed Rules

1. Rules for ML apply to DL ([#37](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/37))
  - Garbage In/Garbage Out ([#26](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/26))
  - Normalize your data ([#7](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/7))
  - Make sure data is not biased/skewed ([#43](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/43))
  - Make it reproducible ([#21](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/21))
  - Validate it ([#27](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/27))
  - Test/train/validate splitting ([#20](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/20), [#19](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/19))

2. Know your data and your question
  - ([#31](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/31), [#12](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/12), [#13](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/13),  [#18](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/18))

3. Choose a model appropriate to the data ([#29](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/29))
  - A bit of discussion on DL architectures and how they apply to different problems here would be helpful

4. Tune your hyperparameters ([#42](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/42), [#11](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/11))
  - Again, discussion on DL specific tuning would be helpful. i.e. layers, dropout, activation functions etc.

5. Limit overfitting ([#28](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/28))
  - Some discussion on how not to overfit particularly in the context of DL methods.

6. Compare to non-DL methods as baselines ([#41](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/41), [#11](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/11), [#10](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/10))

7. A DL model can be, but doesn't need to be a black box
  - How to interpret DL models ([#36](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/36))
  - Similar to [#6](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/6). Check if DL is actually a significant improvement in performance over a more 'interpretable' model ([#25](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/25))

8. Interpret predictions in the correct manner
  - How to apply a model ([#30](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/30))
  - Correlation != Causation ([#9](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/9))
  - Don't overinterpret ([#33](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules/issues/33))
