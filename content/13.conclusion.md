## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Deep learning techniques have the potential for wide use in biology and the capacity to meet or exceed the performance of both humans and the current state-of-the art algorithms across a wide range of tasks.
Beyond simply achieving good predictive performance, deep learning has the potential to inform novel biological insights to fundamentally drive high value research.
To realize this potential, the use of deep learning as a research tool must be approached as any other tool would be: scientifically and thoughtfully.
We hope that our tips for applying deep learning to the biological sciences will serve as a starting point for discussion and not as an ending point.
