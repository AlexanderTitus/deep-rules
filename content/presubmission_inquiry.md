Dear Dr. Markel,

It is with great enthusiasm that I am writing to submit a presubmission inquiry for a Ten Simple Rules article entitled “Ten Simple Rules for Deep Learning in Biology.” Deep learning (DL) is exploding in popularity and is increasingly finding its way into biological data analysis. However, since most biologists rarely receive formal training in DL, its correct application to biological data analysis remains a daunting task that hinders scientific progress and enhanced biological insight.


Alone, DL is a large and complex field. Yet additional complexity
is added when applied to biology. Inspired by [*Opportunities and obstacles for
deep learning in biology and medicine*](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387)
and [*Ten Simple Rules for Writing a PLOS Ten Simple Rules
Article*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003858) (Rule 5: Collaborate), I propose to write the article using Manubot, a collaborative manuscript authoring platform based on GitHub. By writing the manuscript in the open on GitHub (which is extensively used by those actively conducting DL research) and soliciting input from the wider scientific community, I am convinced that this manuscript will provide actionable, DL-specific guidance for both new and experienced DL practitioners.


To accomplish this goal, I have created a
[repository](github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules) that will host the discussion
and writing of the manuscript. In preparation for submitting this letter of
inquiry, the following ten rules have been proposed:

<!-- just using 1. for each entry so that they can be more easily reordered -->

1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum
1. Lorem ipsum

These rules range from high-level guidance to implementation of best practices and they have been devised to effectively reach audiences of varying expertise.
Upon notification that this manuscript will be suitable for submission to PLOS Computational Biology, I will further engage with the community to solicit feedback and contributions. All authors of the paper will meet the ICMJE authorship standards.

By providing guidance on DL, these powerful methods can be more properly utilized by computational as well as experimental biologists. Here, we aim to increase the accessibility of DL techniques to biology and thereby improve the overall quality and reproducibility of DL in the literature.


Sincerely,

Benjamin Lee
