## Introduction {#intro}

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning focusing on artificial neural networks with many layers.
These methods are increasingly being used for the analysis of biological data [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387].
In many cases, novel biological insights have been revealed through careful evaluation of deep learning methods ranging from predicting protein-drug binding kinetics [@doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02388-1] to identifying the lab-of-origin of synthetic DNA [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05378-z].
However, for researchers and students entirely new to this area and those experienced in using classical machine learning methods (for example, linear regression), using deep learning correctly can be a daunting task.
Furthermore, the lack of concise recommendations for biological applications of deep learning poses an additional challenge for newcomers wishing to apply state-of-the-art deep learning in their research.
Since deep learning is an active and specialized research area, detailed resources are rapidly rendered obsolete, and only a few resources articulate general deep learning best practices to the scientific community broadly and the biological community specifically.
To address this issue, we solicited input from a community of researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests to write this manuscript collaboratively using the GitHub version control platform [@url:https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules] and Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

Through the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying machine learning fundamentals [@doi:10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3] as a baseline for utilizing deep learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by means of deep learning, among others.
Both deep learning models and the datasets to which they are applied impact prediction results, so it is important to consider both when generating biological or clinical insights from these methods.
Ultimately, the tips we collate range from high-level guidance to the implementation of best practices.
It is our hope that they will provide actionable, deep learning-specific advice for both new and experienced deep learning practitioners alike who would like to employ deep learning in biological research.
By increasing the accessibility of deep learning for applications in biological research, we aim to improve the overall quality and reporting of deep learning in the literature, enabling more researchers to utilize these state-of-the art modeling techniques.
